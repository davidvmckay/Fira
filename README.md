## How to Contribute to Fira
Have a look at Mozilla’s Fira Roadmap, to see if your proposed contribution already planned. 


Contact Patryk Adamczyk (padamczyk@mozilla.com) to see how your proposed contribution can be integrated into the typeface family and what its timing will be.

Fira is designed and compiled using Glyphs, so the prospective contributor will need to either purchase a copy (https://www.glyphsapp.com/buy) or provide a contribution in a format that Glyphs can read (eg, UFO or OTF) using another font editor (eg FontForge http://fontforge.org)

The contributor should work with the latest Fira GLYPHS source files found here: https://github.com/mozilla/Fira/tree/master/source/glyph

Once the contribution is complete, Ralph Carrois’ team will take the contributed GLYPHS source and integrate it with the Fira master source.

The contribution will be released in the next Fira update
