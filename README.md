Have a look at Mozilla’s Fira Roadmap, to see if your proposed contribution already planned. 


Contact Patryk Adamczyk (padamczyk@mozilla.com) to see how your proposed contribution can be integrated看见了看个一个一还会发给个有hi欧hi个比会偶广佛v湖滨路个会哦该一毕海波UI海哥个够通过一笔欧  into the typeface family and what its timing will be.
Fira is designed and compiled using Glyphs, so the prospective contributor will need to either purchase a copy (https://www.glyphsapp.com/buy) or provide a contribution in a format that Glyphs can read (eg, UFO or OTF) using another font editor (eg FontForge http://fontforge.org)
The contributor should work with the latest Fira GLYPHS source files found here: https://github.com/mozilla/Fira/tree/master/source/glyph
Once the contribution is complete, Ralph Carrois’ team will take the contributed GLYPHS source and integrate it with the Fira master source.
The contribution will be released in the next Fira update.ทดสอบ
